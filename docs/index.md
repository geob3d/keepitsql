# Welcome to KeepItSql

## Getting Started with KeepItSQL

Welcome to KeepItSQL, a powerful package designed to generate SQL syntax from a dataframe. This package simplifies SQL operations by automatically creating INSERT and UPSERT statements based on your dataframe and the target database.


## Installation

First, you need to install the KeepItSQL package. If it’s available on PyPI, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install keepitsql
```

If it’s not available on PyPI, you can install it directly from the source:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/keepitsql.git
cd keepitsql
pip install .
```


## Modules Overview

KeepItSQL provides two main functionalities:

	•	Insert: Generates an INSERT statement from a dataframe.
	•	Upsert: Generates an UPSERT statement, which can be either a MERGE or INSERT ON CONFLICT statement, based on the database type.

## Quick Start

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/

This site contains the project documentation for the
`calculator` project that is a toy module used in the
Real Python tutorial
[Build Your Python Project Documentation With MkDocs](
    https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/).
Its aim is to give you a framework to build your
project documentation using Python, MkDocs,
mkdocstrings, and the Material for MkDocs theme.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.
